Random shapes appear on the white board after clicking on it.

# Running
```
npm install
npm test
npm start
```

# TODO
  * more tests
  * generating docs
  * rendering shapes centered around the mouse
  * precise clicks (now it's not necessary to click inside the circle to remove it, but on the div that holds it)
